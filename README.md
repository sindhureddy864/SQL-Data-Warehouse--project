 SQL-Data-Warehouse--project
This project showcases a comprehensive data warehousing and analytics solution, spanning the development of a data warehouse to the generation of actionable insights. 

**Bronze Layer:** Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into SQL Server Database.

**Silver Layer:** This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.
**Gold Layer:** Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.

**Project Overview**
**This project involves:**

**Data Architecture:** Designing a Modern Data Warehouse Using Medallion Architecture Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers.
**ETL Pipelines:** Extracting, transforming, and loading data from source systems into the warehouse.
**Data Modeling:** Developing fact and dimension tables optimized for analytical queries.
**Analytics & Reporting:** Creating SQL-based reports and dashboards for actionable insights.
